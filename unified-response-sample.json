      "description": "<p>Stemming from an intense passion for the most flavourful cup of coffee, Able Brewing set out to create a brewer that was as aesthetically pleasing as it was functional. They imagined a product that would easily find itself at home in your kitchen during your morning routine. A product that would successfully showcase the Kone filter that they had painstakingly perfected. <br /><br />Inspired by Japanese and Mid-Century design, the resulting brewer elegantly serves pour over coffee. The multi-part design allows the top brewer portion to be removed once brewing is complete leaving a single pot server. The all ceramic exterior is dishwasher safe.</p>",
